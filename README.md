# thermalCamera
This app is defintely a labor of love. It is meant to view and record two FLIR Lepton thermal camera streams via the PureThermal3 dev board. 
It includes getting temperature from each pixel, so you can mouse over a pixel in the stream and get a temp. 
Recording saves a series of .tiff files to a selectable directory. The files ares saved as 16 bit grey images in their own folder.
Cameras are selectable, so if you are using a laptop you can make sure you're not using you're webcam on accident.
If there are any issues, request, or questions, just make an issue ticket and i'll try to get to it.
